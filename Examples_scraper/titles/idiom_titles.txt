Not my circus, not my monkeys
Waiting with baited breath
Don’t hold your breath
People in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones
Don’t look a gift horse in the mouth
Don’t count your chickens before they hatch
Don’t keep all your eggs in one basket
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
There’s more than one way to skin a cat
Let the cat out of the bag
Open a can of worms
Bull in a china shop
One trick pony
Don’t piss on my leg and tell me it’s raining
Too many chefs in the kitchen
If you can’t handle the heat get out of the kitchen
Running on fumes
One bad apple spoils the bunch
The cream rises to the top
Cut from same cloth
Stick in the mud
Don’t rain on my parade
Even the darkest storm cloud has a silver lining
Mess with a bull you get the horn
It’s always darkest before dawn
When it rains it pours
Time and tide wait for no man
Even a broken clock is right twice a day
For whom the bell tolls
Make hay while the sun is shining
Mellow is the man who knows what he’s missing
Can’t teach an old dog new tricks
Hindsight’s 20/20
Give a mouse a cookie and he’ll ask for a glass of milk
Give an inch and they take a mile
The more the merrier
Measure twice cut once
Give a man a fish, feed him for a day; teach a man to fish, feed him for a lifetime
You can bring a horse to water but can’t make it drink
One man’s trash is another man’s treasure
Burning the candle at both ends
Polishing a turd
Put lipstick on a pig, its still a pig
One step forward two steps back
It’s not over till the fat lady sings
Heavy is the head that wears the crown
Pick your poison
An axe to grind
Big shoes to fill
The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree
Chip off the old block
Chip on your shoulder
Reinvent the wheel
Two peas in a pod
Monkey on your back
Big fish in a small pond
When pigs fly
When hell freezes over
Out of the frying pan and into the fire
The pot calling the kettle black
Frog in boiling water
You gotta kiss a lot of frogs to find a prince
Bat out of hell
Going to hell in a hand basket
Bite off more then you can chew
The bigger they are the harder they fall
The hair of the dog that bit you
Wish in one hand and shit in the other
All who wander are not lost
All that glitters is not gold
Diamond in the rough
Leave no stone unturned
No holds barred
Throw the baby out with the bath water
Everything but the kitchen sink
Slow and steady wins the race
Two sides to to the same coin
Play the hand you’re dealt
When life gives you lemons make lemonade
Put a pin in it
The cherry on top
Icing on the cake
The squeaky wheel gets the grease
Raised nails get pounded
Softer than a baby’s bottom
Hell or high water
Stuck between a rock and a hard place
Airing out your dirty laundry.
Skeletons in your closet
Skating on thin ice
Flying too close to the sun
Toot your own horn
Pat yourself on the back
Catch more flies with honey than vinegar
Kill them with kindness
Eye for an eye makes the whole world blind
In the land of the blind the one eyed man is king
That ship has sailed
Two ships passing the night
The pen is mightier than the sword
Double edged sword
I don’t have a dog in that fight
Spare the rod, spoil the child
Like water off a ducks back
The juice isn’t worth the squeeze
Can’t get blood from a stone
Don’t judge a book by its cover
You can’t step into the same river twice
Don’t whistle up the wind
Stick a fork in me
This goose is cooked
You shake it more than twice you’re playing with it
Why buy the cow when the milk is free
Don’t rock the boat
If the shoe fits, wear it
If it walks like a duck, talks like duck, it’s probably a duck
Waiting for the other shoe to drop
The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence
Birds of a feather flock together
What's good for the goose is good for the gander
Early bird gets the worm
Let sleeping dogs lie
A stitch in time saves nine
Every dog has his day
Reap what you sow
Till the cows come home
Chickens come home to roost
Missed the forest for the trees
When in Rome, do as the Romans do
6 in one hand half dozen in the other
6 ways to Sunday
Burning bridges
Baked in the cake
A wolf in sheep’s clothing
Does a bear shit in the woods
Raining cats and dogs
Oldest trick in the book
I’m picking up what you’re putting down
Biting the hand that feeds you
Put you’re money where your mouth is?
Get your ducks in a row
As the crow flies
The lights are on by nobody is home
Not playing with a full deck
Pay the pied piper
Got a screw loose
Walk a mile in someone’s shoes
This isn’t my first rodeo
Bury the hatchet
Proof is in the pudding
Look what the cat dragged in
Spill the beans
At loose ends
Canary in a coal mine
Screwed the pooch
All hands on deck
Crying wolf
Cross your t’s dot your i’s
Over the moon
Shoot for the stars
Read between the lines
Put that in you’re pipe and smoke it
Rode hard and put away wet
Put the axe to the grindstone
A penny saved is a penny earned
Key to my heart
Not in the cards
You can’t have your cake and eat it too
Kill two birds with one stone
I don’t have a horse in that race
That’s the way the cookie crumbles
A straight arrow
On the straight and narrow
Fall off the wagon
Knocking on death’s door
Pushing daisies
Every rose has its thorn
Lightning never strikes the same place twice
Dog eat dog world
It’s a small world after all
Smoke em if you got em
On the tip of your tongue
Pulled the short straw
Dear in headlights
Babe in the woods
Cold feet
Caught red handed
Going hard in the paint
On the fence
In the weeds
Putting the cart before the horse
Paint the town red
Pipe dream
Chasing the dragon
Don’t blow smoke up my ass
Monkey see monkey do
Pull yourself up by your bootstraps
Rat race
Written in stone
Smooth sailing
All down hill from here
Shooting blanks
Pushing rope
Blacker the berry sweeter the juice
Over my dead body
Raise the roof
It takes village to raise a child
Get on board
Below the belt
0 to 60
Turn on a dime
Once bitten twice shy
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
Don’t shit where you eat
Don’t dip the pen in company ink
Pulling your leg
Jerking your chain
The Blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb
Stabbed in the back
Glass half empty
Well runs dry
Strike gold
Ruling with an iron fist
Now we’re cooking with gas
Not on the same page
Stop and smell the roses
Slippery slope
Pick your battles
On my last leg
Watch a pot it never boils
The tip of the iceberg
Needle in a haystack
Still waters run deep
An elephant never forgets
Trojan horse
Like a fish in water
Where there’s smoke there’s fire
Shot in the dark
If you can’t beat ‘em join em
Low hanging fruit
Let it slide
Pass the buck
X marks the spot
15 minutes of fame
Hit the spot
Made in the shade
Run for your money
Chopped liver
Out to lunch
Circling the drain
That’s the ticket
Sloppy seconds
Back in the fold
Take someone under your wing
We’re not in kansas anymore
Out of the woods
Balls of steel
Eyes too big for your stomach
Doe eyed
Snug as a bug in a rug
The cat that ate the canary
Tongue twister
Roll of the dice
He’s lost his marbles
Playing with fire
Dead of night
Perfect storm
Cut corners
Tall drink of water
The road less traveled
A square peg in a round hole
Bouncing off the walls
Tie a pork chop around it neck to get the dog to play with it
Color me pink
Like lemmings to the sea
A scholar and a gentleman
Gone with the wind
Old hat
Doesn’t fit the mold
Left a bad taste in your mouth
Cold shoulder
Tongue in cheek
When there’s a will there’s a way
No harm no foul
Cut the chord
Hit the hay
Live by the sword die by the sword
Knocking boots
Bumping uglies
Get your ears lowered
Dragging your feet
With your tail between your legs
Spic and span
Roll in the hay
Run the gamut
If it was a snake it would of bit you
If looks could kill
Staring daggers
No skin off my back
Carrot on a stick
Comparison is the thief of joy
Robbing the cradle
Going the way of the buffalo
Shell of your former self
The call is coming from inside the house
Coming out swinging
Rose colored glasses
Fog of war
The whole 9 yards
Turning over in your grave
Shooting fish in a barrel
Light a fire under your ass
An old flame
Up in smoke
Fighting fire with fire
Firing in all cylinders
The lion’s share
Pedal to the metal
Throw in the towel
Waking up on the wrong side of the bed
Wrong side of the tracks
Dumpster fire
The front lines
Don’t cry over spilt milk
Meat shield
Throw up a white flag
Throw down the gauntlet
Getting your foot in the door
One foot out the door
Dip your toe in
Test the waters
Play the field
Play ball
Throw it at the wall and see what sticks
Watch a pot it never boils
That’s all she wrote
Head too big to fit in the door
Kick the can down the road
Stepping on toes
Reading the writing in the wall
Coming out of the woodwork
If walls could talk
Fly on the wall
The walls have ears
Blow this popsicle stand
Till the wheels fall off
Hot on your tail
Bone to pick
Put out to pasture
Ball and chain
Down in the dumps
Don’t let the bed bugs bite
Smoke and mirrors
Running circles around someone
Picking up slack
Burning the midnight oil
Pass the torch
Butterflies in your stomach
The lady doth protest too much
Not all hero’s wear capes
Walking on eggshells
Treading water
Keeping your head above water
Under the table
Tables have turned
Deep-6
6 feet under
Look on the bright side
Casting a wide net
Paint with broad strokes
Food for thought
Penny pinching
Cream of the crop
Separate the wheat from the chaff
Reel it in
Right hand man
No man is an island
Revenge is a dish best served cold
Opportunity is not a lengthy visitor
If you want to make an omelette you have to break some eggs.
Give ‘em enough rope to hang himself with
Kick them while they’re down
Tying the knot
Tie up loose ends
If it ain’t broke don’t fix it
My ears are burning
The ball is in your court
Once in a blue moon
As right as rain
The bark is worse than the bite
Path of least resistance
Keeping me on my toes
Go touch grass
In a pickle
Caught with your hand in the cookie jar
Trim the fat
Taking candy from a baby
To flesh out
Get ahead of the game
In the trenches
Cross that bridge when we come to it
Take at at face value
Toe the line
Draw a line in the sand
On framing time
Hold my beer
Don’t feed them after midnight
Short end of the stick
Beating a dead horse
Slippery fish
Snake in the grass
Sit back and rest on your laurels
Barefoot and pregnant
Rule of thumb
Ring a bell
Fly by the seat of your pants
Play stupid games win stupid prizes
On the nose
Hit the nail on the head
Kick the bucket
Strike while the iron is hot
Set in stone
The clay is dry
Trail of bread crumbs
Hanging on by a thread
Green thumb
Splitting hairs
Beast of burden
Hang me out to dry
With out a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of
Without a leg to stand in
Paint yourself into a corner
Shooting from the hip
Outside of my wheelhouse
Above my pay grade
Caught in the crosshairs
Target on you back
Price on your head
Death by 1000 cuts
Can’t trust them as far as you can throw them
Throw caution to the wind
Hold your horses
Bring a knife to a gunfight
Mexican standoff
Play your cards right
Play your cards close to the chest
Ace up your sleeve
Coming in hot
Hold your hand
The 11th hour
A real class act
For the birds
Make ends meet
Wear your heart on your sleeve
Got it in the bag
Idle hands are the devils playground
Secure the bag
Slow your roll
Off the beaten path
Read em and weep
My hands are tied
With one had tied behind my back
Knock your dick in the dirt
Moving the goalpost
Pulling the rug from under you
All roads lead to rome
Walk in the park
Too many irons in the fire
Two tacos short of a combination plate
A whole other ball game
Burying your head in the sand
Burn a hole in your pocket
Letting your true colors shine
If you fall of your horse you gotta get back on
If you want to make god laugh make a plan
Gun shy
Trigger happy
You can’t take it with you
Doesn’t pack a punch
A drop in the bucket
Opiate of the masses
The faster they rise the harder they fall
Out of sight out of mind
Wearing multiple hats
Jack of all trades
The nearer the bone the sweeter the meat
To worry is to make payments on a debt that may never come due
A rolling stone gathers no moss
Necessity is the mother of invention
A day late and a dollar short
Sixpence none the richer
Lose the battle but win the war
Uncharted waters
For whom the bell tolls
Never look into another bowl except to see if they have enough
A rose by any other name would smell as sweet
He who laughs last laughs best
Kiss the ring
A prison of our own device
What goes around comes around
If your going to get we you might as well go swimming
Don’t cry over spilt milk
Put someone on a pedestal
The view from your ivory tower
On your high horse
Turn a blind eye
Cat got your tongue
Hard nut to crack
Up shit creek without a paddle
Even the Mona Lisa is falling apart
Diamonds are made under pressure but not over night
Men are from mars, women are from Venus
Reopen an old wound
Pour salt in the wound and expect it to heal
Swimming with the fishes
Light at the end of the tunnel
Pride is a cold bedfellow
Cut off the head and the body will die
The little dutch boy with his finger in the dike
A hard pill to swallow
Nothing left to do but bite the bullet
Bring home the bacon
Butter your bread on both sides
Slap my ass and call me Sally
The bigger the pants the deeper the pockets
Ask me your questions I’ll tell you my lies
In the belly of the beast
Wild goose chase
Jack of all trades
Cut the mustard
Don’t pull the wool over my eyes
Shoot yourself in the foot
Salad days
Bone to pick
Bigger fish to fry
Herding cats
Taste of your own medicine
March to the best of your own drum
Cross your heart and hope to die
Scraping the bottom of the barrel
Gift that keeps on giving
Let me sleep on it
Don’t sleep on it
Down the rabbit hole
Level the playing field
Your ass is grass
Don’t shoot the messenger
Don’t hate the player hate the game
Bucket list
Partner in crime
Anyway you slice it
All is fair in love and war
Above my pay grade
Not on my dime
Light in the loafers
Rubbing elbows
Beating around the bush
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer
Keep your eyes on the prize
Under the radar
Take under your wing
Straw that broke the camel’s back
Late in the game
Last straw
Connect the dots
Dancing with the devil
When push comes to shove
Been around the block
Eye for an eye
Eyes in the back of your head
In the clear
Cold turkey
We’re gonna need a bigger boat
It’s all greek to me
How do you like them apples
Break the mold
Worth your weight in salt
Turn on a dime
Hold down the fort
I’m all ears
Bend over backwards
Wrapped around their little finger
No spring chicken
Counting sheep
Leg up in life
Put your pants on one leg at a time
Boots on the ground
Down to the nitty gritty
Knock on wood
Salt of the earth
Under the weather
Fly in in the ointment
Nothing to write home about
A hired gun
Dropped the ball
Bury the hatchet
Open the floodgates
See a man about a horse
Taken with a grain of salt
Trust you as far as i can throw you
You made your bed now you got to lay in it
Rolling with the punches
Two way street
Double down
Stand your ground
Dust your shoulders off
Blowing steam
Thrown to the wolves
Throw under the bus
Raised by wolves
Leaving a trail of breadcrumbs
Get with the program
Water under the bridge
Shit or get off the pot
On the shoulders with of giants
Pull out all the stops
Steal their thunder
Wash your hands of the whole affair
Break the bank
Speak of the devil and he shall appear
Curiosity killed the cat but satisfaction brought it back
Wake up and smell the coffee
You can’t put the toothpaste back in the tube
A pictures worth a 1000 words
Doing the lord’s work
When small men cast long shadows the day is almost over
Meat and potatoes
Beating your head against the wall
Barking up the wrong tree
Falling on deaf ears
Don’t ask how the sausage is made
The emperor’s new clothes
Kick into gear
Shooting the shit
Something’s rotten in denmark
Exit stage left
Waiting for the dust to settle
Throw dust in your eyes
Achilles heel
A chain is only as strong as it’s weakest link
A chink in the armor
Missing link
Changing gears
When you hear hoofbeats think horses not zebras
In over your head
Plenty of fish in the sea
My dogs are barking
Make it rain
Put your money where your mouth is
Maiden voyage
No guts no glory
Flash in the pan
It’s better to burn out than fade away
Left in the lurch
High and dry
Bury the lead
The sky is the limit
A rising tide lifts al boats
Served on a silver platter
Fed from a silver spoon
The road paved in gold
Pillow talk
Get the ball rolling
Long walk off a short pier
Bent out of shape
Rule the roost
Leave the table while you still have an appetite
Fair weather friend
Jump the gun
Show you the ropes
Getting something under your belt
Shit a brick
Balls to the wall
Deep dive
Kick rocks
Takes the cake
Wrap it up
Cut some slack
When shit hits the fan
Under the sun
Gravy train
Hill i’m willing to die on
Let your hair down
Time to hang up your hat
Kick to the curb
Clean slate
On top of the world
Cut me to the quick
Nothing to hang your hat on
Pull some strings
Shit the bed
Another notch on your belt
Shits and giggles
Neck and neck
Get this show on the road
Play it by ear
Getting something off your chest
Staying in your own lane
Put it past someone
Trusting you as far as you can throw them
Closed mouths don’t get fed
Throw me a bone
Not my cup of tea
Spill the tea
Off the bat
Pulling a rabbit out of a hat
Scratched the surface
Rub off on someone
Off the deep end
Toe to toe
By a hair
Chip in
The whole enchilada
The whole kit and caboodle
Flavor of the month
Sight for sore eyes
In the pit of your stomach
Lump in your throat
Knock out of the park
On pins and needles
Chicken with its head cut off
Over the hill
Piece of cake
Have a cow
Bum rush
To die for
Blow your cover
Don’t judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree
The devil is in the details
Cleanliness is next to godliness
This town ain’t big enough for the two of us
Time for a gun fight
Pop you’re cherry
Get your rocks off
Rock your socks off
Cool your jets
Knee jerk reaction
Ruffle your feathers
Turn over a new leaf
Rounding the bend
Par for the course
Up in arms
With guns blazing
Make heads or tails of it
Tits up
Sit on it
Sticking your foot in your mouth
Get off on the wrong foot
Bright eyed and bushy tailed
Squeezing the lemon
Bleeding the lizard
Choking the chicken
Beating the meat
Flicking the bean
Soften the blow
Sitting pretty
Tasted grapes
Cloud 9
Walking on sunshine
Putting in leg work
In the limelight
15 minutes of fame
Hit the bricks
End of the line
In the thick of it
Run of the mill
Off the cuff
Dark night of the soul
Off the rails
Living under a rock
True measure of a man
To live in someone’s shadow
To never measure up
Golden goose
Beyond the pale
Revenge is a dish best served cold
Fall from grace
This day in age
Do the honors
That tracks
Pull the trigger
In the the chute
Down the hatch
Batten down the hatches
To not give two shits
Dog and pony show
Throw your hat in the ring
My enemy’s enemy is my friend
Taking the high road
Have a falling out
A broken record
A bridge too far
Think outside the box
One fell swoop
Addressing the elephant in the room
Opening up pandora’s box
Pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
Live off the fat of the land
Get a lay of the land
Get the juices flowing
Eye opening
Poking the bear
Spin a web of lies
Coming out of your shell
Shedding your skin
Put some feelers out
Barrel of monkeys
Monkey see monkey do
Getting your ass handed to you
Come full circle
High on the hog
Taking the words out of someone’s mouth
To be blown away
Setting the bar low
Game changer
Keep your eyes peeled
Hell hath no fury like a woman’s scorn
Top notch
Hit or miss
Shooting your shot
Hidden gem
Too big for your britches
Get a big head
Getting on your soap box
Preaching to the choir
Had it up to here
Turn an burn
On a roll
Short fuse
Hot headed
Having a ring to it
Dropping the kids off at the pool
Bun in the oven
Another face in the crowd
A fine line
Saving something for a rainy day
Shaking in your boots
Water water all around and not a drop to drink
Let your guard down
Hole in the wall
Pulling teeth
Take a load off
Shit end of the stick
Tide me over
By the skin of your teeth
Ride on someone’s coattails
Shit rolls down hill
In a heartbeat
Calm before the storm
Take by storm
Lift the veil
A feather in your cap
Clear cut
Head over heals
Going for broke
Steal the show
In a nutshell
Throw away the key
In hog heaven
Joined at the hip
Over your head
In too deep
Under the spotlight
Under a microscope
Tag team
Break a leg
Chips stacked against someone
Different animal
Apple of my eye
Lift the lid
On the fly
Out of touch
Get your knickers in a twist
Stake your claim
Hold a candle
Bought the farm
Cliff hanger
Out of the loop
Snap out of it
Parse out
Pan out
Back to brunch
Down the drain
Kiss of death
Bees knees
Fly off the handle
Let loose
Come to grips
From the ground up
I’ll be a monkeys uncle
Rally the troops
Off the charts
Pain in the ass
Bases are covered
Next level
Read the fine print
The jury is out
Breaking the seal
Going all in
Upping the ante
Tipping point
Ace in the hole
Easter egg
At a crossroad
Selling your soul to the devil
Head to head
Hand to hand
Blow it to kingdom come
Fountain of youth
Head in the clouds
Rein it in
To no avail
Wrap your mind around it
Fork in the road
Fill someone in
Put it on the back burner
Trickle in
Last man standing
Put a cork in it
Bottled up
Man of the hour
Start off on the right foot
End on a good note
Scratching my head
Mind’s eye
Going to town
Blow your load
Give it a shot
Shake it off
Shake a leg
Take something off your plate
Leave you hanging
If wishes were horses then beggars would ride
Dead in the water
Shake your tail feathers
Egg on your face
Get a bee in your bonnet
Reaching the end of your rope
Bring something to the table
Give someone lip
Out of the blue
Night and day
If you build it they will come
Ride it out
Going to the end of the earth
Blood on your hands
Stick it to the man
Pull the plug
Pushing someone’s buttons
Go wherever the wind takes you
Loose cannon
Being in someone’s corner
Taking the piss
To be on fire
Clap back
Sound the alarm
Count your blessings
Bag of tricks
Go out on a limb
Glass ceiling
The powder trail is lit
Under the hood
Chip away at something
Take a stab at something
Plant the seed
Hit the ground running
Bite the dust
Pull it off
Get under your skin
Across the board
Take something and run with it
Come to terms
Setting the stage
Put someone on blast
In the ballpark
Lean into it
Change of heart
Weed out
Thinning the herd
Send someone for a loop
Keep in touch
On the same/different level
Match made in heaven
Bottom line
Hand in glove
Wind down/wind up
Ramping up
To piggyback off of something
Thread the needle
Chicken out
Lose your head
Run it up the flagpole
Another nail in the coffin
Hit rock bottom
Eagle eye
Out of left field
Half cocked
Heart to heart
Sitting duck
Sticking your neck out for someone
Clear the air
Put a sock in it
To put your finger on something
Have your finger on the pulse
Buckle down
Blow over
Work yourself into a lather
Ham it up
Be my guest
Blow it out of the water
To sink in
When something goes pear shaped
I’ll fall on that sword
Sleep with one eye open
Get back in the saddle
Fired up
Bobs your uncle
Rub someone the wrong way
To yank someone’s chain
Something in the wind
Keep the train rolling
Get your head in the game
Being on the ball
Back against the wall
Backed into a corner
Smuggling plums
Get to the bottom of some thing
Bottom of the totem pole
Buckle up
Scratches that same itch
Flying off the shelf
Off to the races
Grind my gears
Locked and loaded
Cut and dried
Slip through the cracks
Close a chapter
Knock out
Take it on the chin
Dig your own grave
Put it all on the line
Over the top
Touch base
Within an inch of life
Picking your brain
A slap in the face
A slap on the wrist
Taking a nose dive
Rolls off the tongue
To have someone’s back
Picking something up
Licking someone’s boots
Kissing someone’s ass
On deck
Out of hand
Roll up your sleeves
Piss on a page
Licking your wounds
In a pinch
To put someone on the spot
As the twig is bent so grows the tree
Middle of the road
Stick up your ass
Up in the air
Spit on your grave
Dont piss into the wind
Go to bat
Cooking something up
Thumb up your ass
Shit dont stink
Cherry picking
Hot to trot
A wake up call
Cutting your teeth on something
Dont go chasing waterfalls
Twisting in the wind
Put the pussy on the chain wax
If frogs had glass asses they would would only hop once
The cock of the walk
Not on my watch
