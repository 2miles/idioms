The proverb "those who live in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones" is often cited as originating in Chaucer’s _Troilus and Criseyde_ written in 1385. It is an epic poem, written in Middle English, that tells the story of two tragic lovers against the backdrop of the Siege of Troy. It is sometimes cited as Chaucer’s best work and is also considered to be the origin of the phrase "all good things must come to an end." In the poem, the proverb reads:

> ... who that hath a head of verre, From cast of stones ware him in the werre.

In 1651, George Herbert used the same phrase but in a way that’s far more recognizable to the modern reader. It read:

> Whose house is of glass, must not throw stones at another.

The phrase was first used in America in "William & Mary Quarterly," a public journal published in Virginia. The quote, from Benjamin Franklin, read:

> Don’t throw stones at your neighbors, if your own windows are glass.

By this time, the phrase is almost exactly that which is most commonly used today. This evolution from the 1300s to the 21st century is not unusual. Often idioms and proverbs change as the English language does.

The first appearance of this idiom is in Thomas Shelton’s translation of _Don Quixote_ in 1620. The line reads:

> You are like what \[it\] is said that the frying-pan said to the kettle, "Avant, black-browes".

These words are spoken by the protagonist whose growing frustrated with Sancho Panza, his servant. In the translation, the words are identified as a proverb that’s used to redirect criticism on someone who plainly has the same faults, habits, or desires.

A few years later, in 1639, the idiom appeared in John Clarke’s _Paroemiologia Anglo-Latina_, a collection of proverbs. It wasn’t until 1682 though, that the idiom neared the wording that’s commonly used today. This is often the case with these colloquialisms. They start off hundreds of years ago with period-appropriate language and then evolve as the years pass to something that’s more widespread and often easier to understand.

In _Some Fruits of Solitude in Reflections and Maxims_ by William Penn, the phrase “is for the Pot to call the Kettle black” comes after a passage about temperance, tyranny, and rebellion.
